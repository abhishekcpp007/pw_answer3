An execution context consists of three main components:

Variable Environment: This component contains all the variables, function declarations, and function arguments available within the current scope. It also includes the scope chain, which determines the order in which variables are accessed.

Lexical Environment: This component is similar to the variable environment, but it remains the same throughout the entire execution process. It includes all the variables and function declarations from the enclosing scopes, even after the execution context has been popped off the stack.

This Value: It refers to the value of the this keyword within the current context. The value of this depends on how a function is called or how an object method is invoked.

Execution Context Stack
+----------------------+
|                      |
|   Execution Context  |
|     (Function A)     |
|                      |
+----------------------+
|   Execution Context  |
|     (Function B)     |
|                      |
+----------------------+
|   Global Execution   |
|       Context        |
|                      |

In this example, we have two functions, Function A and Function B, and the global execution context. When the JavaScript program starts running, the global execution context is created. It represents the initial environment for executing the code and includes the global scope.

As Function A is invoked, a new execution context for Function A is created and pushed onto the top of the execution context stack. The execution of Function A begins, and variables, function declarations, and the scope chain specific to Function A are set up in its variable environment.

If Function A calls Function B, a new execution context for Function B is created and added to the top of the stack. The execution of Function B proceeds in a similar manner, with its own variable environment and scope chain.

Once the execution of Function B is complete, its execution context is popped off the stack, and the program returns to executing Function A. Finally, when the execution of Function A is finished, its execution context is also popped off the stack, leaving the global execution context as the only one remaining.

The execution context stack represents the order in which the execution contexts were created. The topmost execution context is always the one currently being executed. When a function or block of code finishes executing, its execution context is removed from the stack, and the control returns to the previous context.

This concept of execution contexts and the execution context stack helps manage variable scopes, function calls, and the tracking of program execution in JavaScript.
